                             "Tracking clinical features through families and linking them to genetic variants is a frequent task in clinical genetics and genetics research. This is frequently done through pedigree drawings (family trees). Unfortunately, due to the lack of easy to use pedigree drawing programs, this is usually done manually on a piece of paper. This makes pedigree drawings difficult to handle and also precludes any computational analysis. For example, you cannot click on an individual in a paper-drawn pedigree to open the associated database record.",

Currently, prevalence rates of scabies in Indigenous communities are established through screening events, or based on clinic presentation data. In screening events, a questionnaire developed from a sales app (DoForms) is used. In this, demographic information is preloaded onto the form, data is either typed or entered numerically during the screening, and the information is downloaded to an excel spreadsheet at the completion of the screening.

A visually based app would allow community members to take part in disease control efforts—effectively empowering them to crowd-source management of their own health.

We are hoping to use this app to answer a diverse set of research questions of interest to our group, including how mood and alertness effect decision-making, how addiction behaviors manifest in the real world, and how sleep quality affects daytime alertness and behavior. We are particularly interested in developing new time-series analysis techniques to develop individual prediction models for these unique datasets, information that could be use to inform interventions and to cluster individuals based on their behavioural responses. The potential size of datasets that we can collect using such an app, and the richness of the temporal sampling is unprecedented in our field, and we are really excited to have the opportunity to pursue this new paradigm in data collection and analytics!"

After a series of analyses and filtering processes, sometimes >200 gene variants will be identified as possible candidates. Researchers must then decide the best candidate genes to move into their basic and translational research programs. Laboratory studies and disease models are costly in both time and funding, so it is essential to maximise our ability to prioritise candidate genes from the genomics pipeline.",

Improving public critical thinking in the use of these information sources should increase the efficiency and outcomes of human/health-system interactions. Critical thinking is a verb. Top-down dissemination of information will not support this sort of learning. Developments in interactive journalism may be able to provide a way to impact upon public critical thinking.For example, a person who has been recently diagnosed with a mental illness might be interested in understanding the media around their diagnosis. A not-for-profit working to relieve mental illness might be interested in facilitating that conversation about media perceptions. In response to a disease outbreak, (such as ebola), an individual may be interested in understanding how the media representations shape our perceptions. An international relief agency may be interested in monitoring the response to inform their media campaigns for donations.",

However this pipeline needs improvement to make it more generally usable and flexible. Within our research group, this will make Rubra accessible to biologists with limited programming skills, and allow us to easily customise our workflow for each new experiment. This will take us closer to understanding the genomic basis for climate adaptation, which in turn will let us identify the types of species most in need of protection under climate change."
